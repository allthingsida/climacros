# What is *climacros*?

CLI macros is a productivity tool that lets you define and use static or dynamic macros in IDA's command line interfaces (IDC, Python, WinDbg, BochDbg, gdb, etc.).

![Quick introduction](docs/_resources/climacros-vid-1.gif)

## Usage

When installed, *climacros* is always active. It comes with a predetermined set of macros:

![Default macros](docs/_resources/climacros-defaults.png)

To create or edit new macros, simply invoke the macro editor from the "Quick plugins view" window (Ctrl-3).

### Static macros

Static macros get substituted as-is in the CLI. For example the following macro:

![Static macro](docs/_resources/climacros-static-macro-create.png)

Outputs the following when executed:

### Dynamic macros

It is possible to define dynamic macros that get expanded as a result of evaluating a Python expression that returns a string.
For example, the `idc.here()` command is very useful and can be abbreviated with a shorter macro, say `$!` or `${here}`.

To define a dynamic macro, just surround the its expression with `${` and `}$`.

The long form macro `${here}` for the `idc.here()` expression is defined like this:

![Long form here() macro](docs/_resources/climacros-dynamic-create-here.png)

The short form `$!`:

![Long form here() macro](docs/_resources/climacros-dynamic-list-here.png)

A macro is invoked when it is present in a CLI command:

### Inline substitution

You don't have to define macros in order to get expressions expansion in the CLI. If you need a one-off expression expansion in the CLI, just define the expression inline:

```python
fn = "test_${str(sum(range(10)))}$.bin"
```
Or:
```python
v = "${str(1 + 2 + 3 + 4)}$"
```

The expression should always evaluate to a **string**, therefore always remember to `str()` the expression or to format it `"%x" % expr` if it does not return a string.

## Installation

*climacros* is written in C++ with IDA's SDK and therefore it should be deployed like a regular plugin. 

It requires these components to build:

- [`ida-cmake`](https://github.com/allthingsida/ida-cmake)
- and [`idax`](https://github.com/allthingsida/idax)

The first time you run the plugin, it will be populate with the default macros. If you delete all the macros, you won't get back the default macros unless you delete the following file: `%APPDATA%\Hex-Rays/firstrun.climacros`.

On Windows, the macros are saved in the registry under: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Hex-Rays\IDA\CLI_Macros`.
